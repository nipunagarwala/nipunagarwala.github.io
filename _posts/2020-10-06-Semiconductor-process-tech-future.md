There was a recent announcement by TSMC at its 2020 Virtual Technology Symposium about its [3nm risk production](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16024/tsmc-details-3nm-process-technology-details-full-node-scaling-for-2h22) and [2nm node research and development](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/309889-tsmc-starts-development-on-2nm-process-node). It took me a moment to process how far we have been pushing silicon scaling. After all those years of being told that Moore's law was ending and silicon scaling would stop, are we still scaling? How has our assumptions of Moore's law changed? What lies ahead for us?
