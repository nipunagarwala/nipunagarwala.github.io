Movement restrictions in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic provided me time to think about where we are, how we got here (maybe why we are here) and where we are heading. I started to answer these questions with respect to topics that I take specific interest in: Technology, Healthcare, Governance of Nation states, and Social Justice. What I was slow to realize was that all these topics were heavily intertwined in the 21st century (courtesy of Yuval Noah Harari's [21 lessons for the 21st century book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07B77NHHL/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)). This is my attempt to share my thoughts on specific topics that I either came across or might be pertinent at a specific instant, and subsequently connect to larger themes and questions as laid out at the start of this paragraph.
